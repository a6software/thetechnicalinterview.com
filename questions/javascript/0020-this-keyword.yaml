title: "Using the this keyword"
question: |
  What is the value of `this` in the following code sample?
  ```js
  function myFunction() {
    console.log(this);
  }
  myFunction();
  ```
possible_answers:
 - "`this` is the `myFunction` function."
 - "`this` is the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js)."
 - "`this` is `undefined`."
 - "`this` is a reference to the object that the function was called on."

correct_answers:
  - "this is the global object (window in a browser or global in Node.js)."

explanation: |
  In this example, `myFunction` is not called as a method of an object, so `this` will refer to the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js). If `myFunction` was called as a method of an object, then `this` would refer to that object.
