  What is the correct syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?
hint: |
  A for loop is used to iterate over a set of values.
possible_answers:
  - "for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {...}"
  - "for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {...}"
  - "for (var i = 0; i > 10; i++) {...}"
  - "for (var i = 0; i < 10; i--) {...}"

correct_answers:
  - "for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {...}"
  - "for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {...}"

explanation: |
  The correct syntax for a for loop in JavaScript is either `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {...}` or `for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {...}`. The first statement sets the initial value of the loop counter, the second statement is the condition that must be met for the loop to continue, and the third statement is the increment or decrement of the loop counter.
