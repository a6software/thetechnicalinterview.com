  - "A way to perform non-blocking I/O operations"

explanation: |
  The event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows the language to perform non-blocking I/O operations. It works by continually checking the message queue for new messages (such as function calls or events), and processing them one at a time. This allows JavaScript to continue running other code while waiting for I/O operations to complete, making it well-suited for building interactive and responsive user interfaces.
