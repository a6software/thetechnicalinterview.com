title: What is the output of the following code?
question: |
  ```
  let obj = {a:1, b:2};
  let arr = [3,4];
  obj.c = arr;
  console.log(obj);
  ```
hint: |
  Think about what type of data is being added to the object.
possible_answers:
  - "`{a:1, b:2, c:[3,4]}`"
  - "`[3,4]`"
  - "`{a:1, b:2, c:{3,4}}`"
  - "`undefined`"

correct_answers:
  - "`{a:1, b:2, c:[3,4]}`"

explanation: |
  The code declares an object `obj` with properties `a` and `b`, and an array `arr`. It then adds a new property `c` to the `obj` object and assigns the value of the `arr` array to it. The `console.log(obj)` statement outputs the entire object, which now includes the new property `c` with the value of the `arr` array.
