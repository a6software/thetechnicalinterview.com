  # Closures raise your hand

  Consider the following functions `clickHandler`, `immediate`, and `delayedReload`:
   
  ```js  
  let countClicks = 0;
    button.addEventListener('click', function clickHandler() {
    countClicks++;
  });
  ```
  
  ```js 
  const result = (function immediate(number) {
    const message = `number is: ${number}`;
      return message;
    })(100);
  ```
  
  ```js 
  setTimeout(function delayedReload() {
    location.reload();
  }, 1000);
  ```
  
  Which of these 3 functions access outer scope variables?

possible_answers:
  - "`clickHandler`"
  - "`immediate`"
  - "`delayedReload`"

correct_answers:
  - "`clickHandler`"
  - "`delayedReload`"

explanation: |
  * `clickHandler` accesses the variable `countClicks` from the outer scope.
  * `immediate` doesn't access any variables from the outer scope.
  * `delayedReload` accesses the global variable location from the global scope (aka the outermost scope).
