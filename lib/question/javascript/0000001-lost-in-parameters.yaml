question: |
  What will log to console when running the following code snippet:
  
  ```js
  (function immediateA(a) {
    return (function immediateB(b) {
      console.log(a); // What is logged?
    })(1);
  })(0);
  ```

hint: |
  This is some hint text.
  
  It is multiline.

possible_answers:
  - "`1`"
  - "`0`"
  - "`undefined`"
  - this code will not execute

correct_answers:
  - "`0`"

explanation: |
  `0` is logged to the console. Try the demo.

  `immediateA` is called with the argument `0`, thus `a` parameter is `0`.

  `immediateB` function, being nested into `immediateA` function, is a closure that captures `a` variable from the outer `immediateA` scope, where `a` is `0`. 
  
  Thus `console.log(a)` logs `0`.
