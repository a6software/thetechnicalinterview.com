  - Use AWS IAM to provide the sign-up and sign-in functionality.
  - Configure an AWS Config rule to make the API call triggered by the post-authentication event.

explanation: |
  Amazon Cognito adds user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to web and mobile applications quickly

  Users can also create an AWS Lambda function to make an API call to a custom analytics solution
  and then trigger that function with an Amazon Cognito post authentication trigger.
