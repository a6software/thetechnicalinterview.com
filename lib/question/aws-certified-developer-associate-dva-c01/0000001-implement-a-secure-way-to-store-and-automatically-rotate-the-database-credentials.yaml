title: Implement a secure way to store and automatically rotate the database credentials
question: |
  A company is migrating a legacy application to Amazon EC2. The application uses a user name and
  password stored in the source code to connect to a MySQL database. The database will be migrated to an
  Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. As part of the migration, the company wants to implement a secure
  way to store and automatically rotate the database credentials.
  
  Which approach meets these requirements?

hint: |
  This is some hint text.
  
  It is multiline.

possible_answers:
  - Store the database credentials in environment variables in an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Rotate the
    credentials by replacing the AMI.
  - Store the database credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Configure Parameter Store to
    automatically rotate the credentials.
  - Store the database credentials in environment variables on the EC2 instances. Rotate the credentials by
    relaunching the EC2 instances.
  - Store the database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure Secrets Manager to automatically
    rotate the credentials.

correct_answers:
  - Store the database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure Secrets Manager to automatically
    rotate the credentials.

explanation: |
  AWS Secrets Manager helps to protect the credentials needed to access databases, applications,
  services, and other IT resources. 
  
  The service enables users to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. 
  
  Users and applications retrieve secrets with a  call to the Secrets Manager APIs, eliminating the need to hard code sensitive information in plaintext. 
  
  Secrets Manager offers secret rotation with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon
  DocumentDB.
